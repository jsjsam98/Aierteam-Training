## Preface 

There is a Chinese saying called "窥斑见豹", which means that if you can see a part of a leopard, you can imagine the whole animal. This phrase often carries a positive connotation of having an ability to discern the big picture from the obsercation of small details, but sometimes, it can also be used to describe someone who erroneously imagines they comprehend a complex whole based on skewed or incomplete information.
