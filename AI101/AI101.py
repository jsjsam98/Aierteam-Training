# # AI 101 - Say Hi to AI

# # Welcome to AI 101! üöÄ
# 
# This AI 101 notebook will guide you through:
# - Setting up and using OpenAI's API
# - Finish some reading about Large Language Model
# - Write your first promt for Chatgpt
# 
# Let's begin our journey into AI! üåü
# 

# In[8]:


# setup openai client and api key
from openai import OpenAI
client = OpenAI()

# openai will look for OPENAI_API_KEY in environment variables, you can also set it here, be sure to protect your key.
# client.api_key = ""

# ### ü§îHeads-up
# **What is an API?**
# 
# API (Application Programming Interface) is a set of rules and protocols that allows
# different software applications to communicate with each other. 
# 
# **Helpful links**
# 
# https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/rest-api-introduction/
# 
# **Why do we need this when we have chatgpt.com?**
# - integrate AI capabilities directly into our applications
# - process multiple requests programmatically
# - customize the model parameters and system prompts
# - build our own user interfaces and experiences
# - take advantage of different models
# 
# **Programming Language we will be using**
# 
# üêçPython!
# 

# ### üìñReading Content
# 
# *Why 'Large Language Model'*
# - Large: billions of parameters & trained on immense dataset
# - Language: Understand, process, and generate human-like text
# - Model: Built on the Transformer architecture
# 
# *Large Language Model's position in AI world*

# ### üìùWrite your first prompt for Chatgpt
# Tell Chatgpt who you are, what you do, and let Chatgpt commnuicate in as a representative of you.
