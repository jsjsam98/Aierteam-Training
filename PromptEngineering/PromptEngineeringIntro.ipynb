    "### Why Prompt Engineering?\n",
    "For a beginner, learning prompt engineering skills is the best way to understand the capabilities and limitations of large language models (LLMs).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Prompt Engineering Principles\n",
    "1. Give Clear Instruction\n",
    "2. Speciy Format\n",
    "3. Give Few-shots example\n",
    "4. Evaluate Quality\n",
    "4. Make it Reusable & Programmable\n",
    "\n",
    "### Should I prompt the model to answer?\n",
    "For example, when using with Llama-3.2-1B Text Generation Model\n",
    "- prompt 1: \"Q:Explain why sky is blue. A:\" </br>*possible result: Q:Explain why snow is white\n",
    "A:<mark>Snow is white because it is made up of tiny ice crystals that reflect light.</mark>*\n",
    "- prompt 2: \"Explain why snow is white\" </br>*possible result: Explain why snow is white\n",
    "<mark>A. It reflects light.\n",
    "B. It is made of tiny ice crystals.\n",
    "Answer: A</mark>*'\n",
    "\n",
    "Clearly the first one has the result we want, and the second one seems to be completing a question and providing an option.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Short answer**: As of Dec. 2024, if you don't know the answer to this question, you don't need to use a Question-Answer Prompt.\n",
    "**Long answer**: It depends on the type of model you're interacting with and your specific needs:\n",
    "- If you are interacting with a Text Completion Model, and you want a conversation happen, use it.\n",
    "- If you are interacting with an Instruction Model, these models are optimized to handle conversation and instructions, you can simply chat with it as you would normally do.\n"
